# The `democrat` directory

## List of files

The whole corpus (all the texts, including Old French), with the original tokenization and sentence splitting, is avalaible in the `dem_all_corrected.conll` file.

The five legal texts from the 19th and 21st centuries, with parsing (as described in the root README file) but without named entities, is saved in the `demjur_parsed_corrected.conll` file.  These texts, with the original tokenization and sentence splitting, are also available in the `demjur_base.conll` file.

The datebase format, with only the base annotation (field marked with a green circle in the root README file), is saved in the `db_dem_all_corrected_base.zip` file (for the whole corpus) and in the `db_demjur_base.zip` file (for the legal texts).
